Tracks the International Space Station's location and controls an arm to point at it using a microcontroller.

The purpose of this project is to build robotics experience and get a feel for candidate robotics programming languages (Swift, Rust, Julia?, Carbon?), and potentially create a product. The initial target hardware is a [PJRC Teensy 3.2 microcontroller](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html). Repository branches are:

* main: current release code
* dev: latest pre-release development build
* dev-python: a place to test algorithms before implementing them in compiled languages.
